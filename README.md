# Random Scripts :mount_fuji:

Random collection of scripts I wanted to save, but didn't need a whole directory.

## Description

This is a sort of dumping ground for any small scripts that I enjoyed making and wanted to display.  Thank you for looking around!

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python3
* Jupyter Notebook

### Executing

* Most scripts are Python or Python notebook files, run them however you normally would.

### Current Files:
- iterMergeSort.ipynb is a Python notebook file containing an iterative version of the merge sort algorithim.
- pokerGame.ipynb is a Python notebook file containing a simulation of a 4 player game.
    - The winner is whoever draws 4 aces.
    - Cells for: 
        - Running one game / Running games until first win
        - Running 100 games until first win and averaging number of games.
        - Running 100 games, averaging number, and doing that 100 times and averaging the averages.
