    "## Iterative Merge Sort\n",
    "#### By Anthony Simao\n",
    "### Number of iterations required:\n",
    "- n = length of input; number of iterations required = ⌈log₂(n)⌉\n",
    "- Ex. [4,3] = 2 iterations, [8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1] = 3 iterations, [9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1] = 4 iterations\n",
    "### How I did it:\n",
    "- Start with a list of length n.\n",
    "    - Ex. [ 8, 2, 3, 1, 6, 5, 4, 7 ], n = 8\n",
    "- Start with initial sorting size of 2, and split starting list into n/2 groups of size 2.\n",
    "    - Ex. [ [8,2], [3,1], [6,5], [4,7] ], size = 2, # of groups = 4\n",
    "- Call merge on each of the groups, and then place the newly sorted subgroups back into the array.\n",
    "    - Ex. [ 2, 8, 1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 7 ], iteration #1\n",
    "- Sorting size is now doubled, repeat step 2 with new sort size.\n",
    "    - Ex. [ [8,2,1,3], [5,6,4,7] ], size = 4, # of groups = 2\n",
    "- Call merge on each of the groups, and then place the newly sorted subgroups back into the array.\n",
    "    - Ex. [ 1, 2, 3, 8, 4, 5, 6, 7 ], iteration #2\n",
    "- Sorting size is now doubled, repeat step 2 with new sort size.\n",
    "    - Ex. [ [1,2,3,8,4,5,6,7] ], size = 8, # of groups = 1\n",
    "- Call merge on each of the groups, and then place the newly sorted subgroups back into the array.\n",
    "    - Ex. [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ], iteration #3\n",
    "- We now have a sorted list!"
