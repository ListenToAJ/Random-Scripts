    "## Poker Game Card Shuffling\n",
    "#### By Anthony Simao\n",
    "### How I did it:\n",
    "- The first thing I did was to create a custom class for a Card object that holds a number value and a suit.\n",
    "- I then populated a deck of cards with one of each number for each suit (52 cards total).\n",
    "- The next step was to have a singular instance of the game being run and verify that the outputs were correct and I was looking for the right win conditions.\n",
    "- Once I could succesfully run a single game (Most likely with no winners), I put it inside a while loop and counted the number of games it took to succeed. (This was later put in a function due to it's repetition)\n",
    "- That was then put inside of another while loop, that ran it 100 times, tracked each of the number of games needed to run, and averaged them.\n",
    "- That was **again** put into a while loop that ran 100 times, collecting each of the averages to find a overall average, which tends towards 206.\n",
    "- The final step was to seperate out each of those functions in a notebook, add the apropriate printing statements for each example, and clean it all up."

    "### Expected Number of Games (Bonus)\n",
    "A deck of cards has 52 cards total\n",
    "The probability of one person getting 4 aces can be found by finding the number of ways that a player can get 7 extra cards from the remaining non-ace cards (48 total).\n",
    "<br>This is represented as: ${48 \\choose 7}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is then put over the number of ways to distribute 11 cards out of a whole deck in total. Showing the probability of a single player getting 4 aces.\n",
    "<br>This is represented as: $\\frac{48 \\choose 7}{52 \\choose 11}$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is then multiplied by 4, because we have 4 players total.\n",
    "<br>This is represented as: $4 \\cdot \\frac{48 \\choose 7}{52 \\choose 11}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get the number of expected games it would take to reach this probability, you would need to take the reciprocal of that function.\n",
    "<br>This is represented as: $$\\frac{1}{4 \\cdot \\frac{48 \\choose 7}{52 \\choose 11}} = 205.09469697$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we cannot play $.09$ of a game, we use the ceiling function to round up. $$\\lceil 205.09469697 \\rceil = 206$$\n",
    "This is seen in the last cell of my notebook as Python results show that the average of averages tends towards $206$.\n",
